        <h3 id="lesson-text2">You can use variables for storing data. You have to define a variable like this: var/let/const (name) = "text"; <br><br> when you need to call it, just write the variable name.Difference between var,let and const: var declarations are <br><br> globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-<br><br>declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be <br><br> updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. This is helpful because instead of writing <br><br> the data stored in the variable, you just write the variable. It makes coding a whole lot easier.<br><br>Its not only for numbers, variables can also be used to store text.
