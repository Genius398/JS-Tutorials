        <h3 id="lesson-text2">If you already know html and css then you will know what
            is comments. You can use comments for explaining <br><br> what this code is for. 
            If you are working with someone then you can use comments to tell them what they <br><br> should do next. 
            And people who see the website can't see this comment. Let's check how to do that.
            Type a <br><br> paragraph which you want to make it a comment. Before you do that you need a 
            JavaScript file. .js is the <br><br> extension of the JavaScript. You should make it as : TheNameYouWant.js <br><br>
            Type the sentence you want to make it a comment type // + space before it starts or click ctrl+/ . <br><br>
